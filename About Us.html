			J.M. COMMERICAL PRINTERS has been in the business for more than three decades. The printing business has been the forte of the founders, Jose S. Tan and his wife, Monica Tan, since they worked for decades in publishing houses way back in the 1950's, Makabayan Publishing and Capitol Publishing.
	</p>
	<p>
		They garnered the technical know-how in running the business as they directly handle operations. When they had started a family, they continuously worked for the same companies and only began establishing their own company when both publishing houses closed down due to disinterested heirs who had no knowledge when it came to running the business. So in 1997, the company opened with family and friends as initial clients. Little did they know that the Republic of Biscuit Corporation, one of its first and loyal customers would be progressive in just a few years. As a result, Rebisco and all its sister companies have been our loyal customers up to this day. At present, the children of the two founders are the managing team of J.M. COMMERCIAL PRINTERS.
	</p>
	<p>
		They have upgraded the machines and taken lessons in graphic layoutting leading to a more up-to-date technical know-how of the brood. They have also covered different markets from schools, manufacturing companies, hospitals and publishing offices. Their services have also broadened from offset printing to digital printing and packaging. The interests of the company to maintain a sole proprietorship status is exacted by the present management to give due respect to the owner who until this day lends a hand in the operational strategies of the business.
